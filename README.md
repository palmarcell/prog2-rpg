# DE IK High Level Programming Languages II - Game Project

This project's goal is to familiarize students with Java in a more pragmatic way.
This is only an auxiliary side project to the standard curriculum.

## Overview

A basic little adventure game with rpg elements dedicated to providing hands-on examples for some abstract ideas learned in the curriculum.

## Notes for (student) developers

* Use a JDK capable of supporting Java 11 features 
* Please use [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (you can use other IDEs too if you know your way around, but Intellij IDEA is the preferred)
* The project uses Lombok, so please don't forget installing and configuring it [in your IDE too](https://www.baeldung.com/lombok-ide)
* You might want to configure the IDE to [optimize imports on the fly](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-optimizing-imports.html#59fe4)
* When you change your pom.xml make sure the changes get confirmed (the IDE will display a maven symbol on the right of the screen, but you can always access maven's menu from the right sidebar too)
* If some changes don't take immediate effect, then try closing and restarting the IDE (sometimes the IDE's internal state gets bugged out even if maven is working ok)
* Last, but not least: *Don't panic!*
